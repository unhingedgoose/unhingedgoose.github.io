			<h4> About Member 1 <span>| Marielle Eliseo</span></h4>
			A member of the school's Art Club.
			<h4> About Member 2 <span>| Gus Africa</span></h4>
			Wannabe member of the school's Art Club. (Just in Sightlines.)
			<h5> Art Club </h5>
			<p>One of Art Club's most exciting activities is the annual trip, along with Likha and Exposure, to Graphika Manila. Only active members are allowed to go. Marielle has been to Graphika the past two years, and she is hoping to be able to go again this year. The past two years were very fun and memorable for her.
			All of the speakers were very entertaining and knowledgeable about the things they're passionate about. She finds it amazing how so many people from different fields and different parts of the world could come together in one room.
			Their works are all amazing, and knowing their creative process makes it even more amazing than you'd initially think. They also offered advice not just applicable to the arts and business, but also life in general.
			Marielle is very glad that the club hosts this trip every year.</p>
