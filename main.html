					<h1>Graphika Manila</h1>
						
					<p> Graphika Manila is one of the Philippines’s biggest and most influential creativity conference. It was first held in the year 2006, and is held once every year for two consecutive days. The lineup of speakers include creatives from different fields and from all around the world and within our own country. </p>
					<p>Last year’s conference included 12 speakers, with 6 speakers having their talk per day. All tickets are valid for both days of the conference, and you aren’t allowed to buy a ticket for just one day. Tickets can be bought online, or right at the registration booth. Graphika Manila 2019 was held at the SMX Convention Center. They invited creatives Aaron Daplin, Anthony Francisco, Lauren Hom, Buff Monster, Middle Boop, Ivan Dixon, James Sweigert, Justin Harder, Michael Parker, Rian Gonzales, Shane Griffin, and Yeo Kaa. Each creative shared part of their creative journey and offered their own unique advice. They also provided samples of their own works, and we even got to get a glimpse of highly confidential assets, including those of a few Marvel Films.</p>
