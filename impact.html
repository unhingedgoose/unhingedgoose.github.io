					For me, I think the arts are a medium for me to put all my emotions into when I am overwhelmed by the sciences. It's a way for me to channel all my creativity into, when I've exhausted the sciences. Music, theatre, visual arts, writing-- they all let me remove my focus from STEM for a while and just... escape.

					For me, it is one of my escapes whenever the requirements are becoming too stressful. Dancing has been part of my life since I was a kid. It's one of the things I enjoy doing the most, more than studying. Even though for most people learning and memorizing choreographies is hard, it always manages to destress me. Whenever I feel sad, I try to dance it away and most of the time it works. Dancing has been a crucial part of my daily life and it also made me love music in general.<br><br>

					I don't regret going to Pisay but one of things that I do regret is that I may have a hard time getting a career that isn't science related.
