					<h3>Gus Africa, 2023 (Visual Arts, Performance Arts)</h3>
					For me, I think the arts are a medium for me to put all my emotions into when I am overwhelmed by the sciences. It's a way for me to channel all my creativity into, when I've exhausted the sciences. Music, theatre, visual arts, writing-- they all let me remove my focus from STEM for a while and just escape.

					<h3>Troy Valencia, 2023 (Performance Arts)</h3>
					For me, it is one of my escapes whenever the requirements are becoming too stressful. Dancing has been part of my life since I was a kid. It's one of the things I enjoy doing the most, more than studying. Even though for most people learning and memorizing choreographies is hard, it always manages to destress me. Whenever I feel sad, I try to dance it away and most of the time it works. Dancing has been a crucial part of my daily life and it also made me love music in general.<br><br>

					I don't regret going to Pisay but one of things that I do regret is that I may have a hard time getting a career that isn't science related.
					
					<h3>Carlyne Consebido, 2023 (Visual Arts, Performance Arts)</h3>
					
					For me, art is something that detresses me and helps me get back on track. I have always enjoyed drawing and dancing ever since I was a kid. However, I was pressured to focus on my acads, and all my extracurriculars were just MTAP and MTG.<br><br>
When I got into Pisay, I didn't expect that my interest in arts would grow. I've met many amazing, artistic people here. Of course, as a Pisay scholar, I am expected to do good in STEM subjects, but that doesn't mean I can't excel in the arts as well ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª. Sometimes, it's nice to take a break from all my acads and just dance the night away.<br><br>
I may not be allowed to pursure an arts course YET, but I am grateful that Pisay has given me chances to show my love for the arts (Sagala and Art Club!!!!).
